**Interview Technical Assignment - QA Automation (Playwright + TypeScript) Preparation**

You will be invited to a 90-minute session where you will complete a small QA automation project. The project will be evaluated. You will build an automated end-to-end test suite using Playwright and TypeScript. The requirements will be provided at the start of the session.

**Prerequisites**

* A personal GitHub account to use for development and delivery of your project.

* Work in a **private repository** and invite **[simon.luckenuik@valsoftcorp.com](mailto:simon.luckenuik@valsoftcorp.com)** as a collaborator.

* Use any of the following tools to write your tests (or any other of your choice):

  * **Cursor** (free two-week trial available)
  * **Windsurf** (free two-week trial available)
  * **GitHub Copilot** (free 30-day trial available)

* Have a working local setup with:

  * Node.js and npm installed
  * Playwright installed globally or ready to install in the project
  * A code editor of your choice

**Requirements**

* Deliver a working automated test suite within 90 minutes using any development tools, including AI-assisted tools.

  * Notes:

    * Using AI tools is encouraged to stay within the time limit.
    * Focus on getting the main automated scenarios working. Incomplete or partial coverage will be penalized.

* Align your tech stack with the job description:

  * Test framework in **Playwright**
  * Language in **TypeScript**

* Your project **must be runnable locally**. At a minimum, this means:

  * A clear README with:

    * How to install dependencies
    * How to run the tests (for example `npm test` or `npx playwright test`)
  * All required configuration files committed (for example `package.json`, `playwright.config.ts`, TypeScript config if used).

* If possible, provide:

  * One or more logical test suites (for example smoke, regression, critical path).
  * Basic reporting or screenshots on failure, using Playwright built-in features.
  * This is optional but will be considered a plus.

You will receive the document describing the application under test and the test requirements at the start of the 90-minute meeting. You must commit and push your work to GitHub when you are done.
